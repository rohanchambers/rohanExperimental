Bower
When intsalling bower packages use -save (This makes it a dependency)
eg. bower install bourbon --save

Update bower packages
eg. bower bourbon update
all packages: bower update


Grunt
npm install creates package.json
npm install grunt-contrib-uglify --save-dev

*NB Grunt Watch task should always be the last in the registerTalk call. 
To update other tasks on watch i.e. cssmin or combine, on watch add them to the tasks list

BrowserSync sometimes needs to be removed from registered tasks and connect needs to run alone. Then bring sync back in.
Needs host setup

Server setup for project
case 1: Either use browserfy on its own and that loads up your page however then you have to setup a host file and etc... Proxy should be the file to load

case 2: Use Grunt php to setup a quick server. Can't seem to get it to work with BrowserSync. Pro’s to doing this is you don't have to play around with host files etc...

When using Grunt targethtml for cache busting and going live, take the latest dated version reupload the index.php and dist/include files.

Added a .gitignore for all Grunt’s node_modules and .sass-cache


// To remove gutter from elements
@include omega();
@include span-columns(6 of 12, block-collapse);
