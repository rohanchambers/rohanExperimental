What I would have done wit libraries that wasn't mentioned in instructions

- Bourbon and Neat grid
- Mobile first approach
- Three types of black and 3 types of Grey in the psd. Would probably speak to designer to see if we can narrow it down to have continuity.
- I would have used Font awesome for icons but in this case I cut them out. 
- Would have also used a CSS sprite image if there were hovers provided.
- Heart icon is a little shopped off at the bottom
- Bullets were a lot smaller so used a gif. But would probaly speak to designer and ask to be done as css size.
