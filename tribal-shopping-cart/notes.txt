What I would have done permitting other libraries that wasn't mentioned in the technical test instructions.
- Bourbon and Neat grid. I have moved away from Bootstrap as I didn't like using presentational classes.
- Mobile first approach.
- There were three types of blacks and 3 types of Grey in the PSD. I would probably speak to the designer to see if we can narrow it down to have continuity.
- I would have used Font awesome for icons but in this case I cut them out.
- Would have also used a CSS sprite image if there were hovers provided.
- Heart icon is a little shopped off at the bottom
- Bullets were a lot smaller so used a gif. But would probaly speak to designer and ask to be done in CSS.
- I would probably use a templating library such as moustache.js or handlebars.js for removing and adding products to the cart.
-More logic could have been added to the favourites section if I had more time. So as not to be able to keep adding the same favourite item to the favourites.
