What I would have done wit libraries that wasn't mentioned in instructions

- Bourbon and Neat grid
- Mobile first approach
- Three types of black in the psd. Would speak to designer to see if we can use one black
- I would have used Font awesome for icons
- Heart icon is a little shopped off at the bottom
- Would have also used a sprite if there were hovers provided.
- Bullets were a lot smaller so used a gif. But would probaly speak to designer and ask to be done as css size.
