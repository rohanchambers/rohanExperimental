How Can I Contribute?
---------------

**Reporting Bugs**

Reporting bugs is one way to contribute to this project. Make sure to open an issue on the relevant branch, either
Master or Development.

* Before you create an issue, please check the closed issues first to see if your issue hasn't already been addressed.
* When reporting and bug and creating an issue please do the following:
    * Concise description of the issue.
    * Verify the issue is isolated to Some Like it Neat (be sure to test in another theme to see if issue persists).
    * Provide Steps to reproduce the issue.
        1. First Step
        2. Second Step
        3. Third Step etc.
    * Expected behavior. What should have happened instead of the bug you're reporting?
    * What actually happens because of the bug?
    * What version and what branch are you using?
    * Additional configuration can be of assitance, too; i.e. Operating System, version of Node, Gulp Packages etc.
    
**Suggesting Enhancements** 

I'm always open for enhancements to this theme. You can open an issue. Be sure to label the issue with 'enhancement.'

**Code Contributions**

Dang! What a cool ass person you must be to give up some of your free time for an awesome PR (pull request)! I welcome
well-thought and well-implemented code to this project.

How you should contribute your code
* First, clone this project's `development` branch.
* Make all of your necessary changes on the `development` branch and test to ensure it doesn't cause insane breakage. 
Once you're good there, push your changes and create a *pull request.* From there, I'll review the PR and decide to approve it.
When it's approved I will merge your *pull request* into the `development` branch and eventually into the `master` branch.
